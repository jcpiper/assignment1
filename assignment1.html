    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!

				<li>
					In the summer of 2015 I built a web app for the bio department with the Django framework to maintain students' data working towards the 
					<a href="https://rescert.bio.pitt.edu/cert_data/" targert="_blank">Certificate in Life Sciences Research</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					I also served as webmaster for my fraternity, maintaining and updating the chapter website: <a href="http://pittdeltachi.com/" target="_blank">Pitt Delta Chi</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					While serving as webmaster, I also built a new, light weight site with Jekyll to better serve the chapter's recruiting purposes. Although the site is not live yet, the code 
					is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/jcpiper/Pitt-DX" target="_blank">Pitt-DX</a>
