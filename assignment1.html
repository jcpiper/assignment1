				<li>
					In the summer of 2015 I built a web app for the bio department with the Django framework to maintain students' data working towards the 
					<a href="https://rescert.bio.pitt.edu/cert_data/" targert="_blank">Certificate in Life Sciences Research</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					I also served as webmaster for my fraternity, maintaining and updating the chapter website: <a href="http://pittdeltachi.com/" target="_blank">Pitt Delta Chi</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					While serving as webmaster, I also built a new, light weight site with Jekyll to better serve the chapter's recruiting purposes. Although the site is not live yet, the code 
					is available on github: <a href="https://github.com/jcpiper/Pitt-DX" target="_blank">Pitt-DX</a>
